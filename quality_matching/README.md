In this study, we have proposed a method for guiding evaluation of novel imaging devices via simulated trials. We apply domain transformations to publicly available datasets to generate simulations with similar image quality to the device under investigation. We then leverage machine learning to perform automated pathology detection as a surrogate for traditional reads by a radiologist. In this manner, we can investigate the potential sensitivity of a new device to a range of pathologies, without costly and time-consuming prospective data collection. Here, we demonstrate the application of this method to a new portable, 64mT low-field MRI device. This method allows for rapid evaluation of actual or proposed diagnostic imaging devices and can provide guidance and justification for prospective studies. In our simulations, we found that gliomas, strokes, and multiple sclerosis lesions could be detected in low-field quality images. We also characterized size and signal intensity differences affecting lesion detection. This work additionally highlights the importance of centralized data sharing for device design and validation.
